        Discipline in typography is a prime virtue. Individuality
        must be secured by means that are rational. Distinction
        needs to be won by simplicity and restraint. It is equally
        true that these qualities need to be infused wiht a
        certain spirit and vitality, or they degenerate into
        dullness and mediocrity.

        Studying philosophy and traveling have been my passions for a long time. After I finished my doctoral studies at the New School for Social Research, I brought these two passions together and over the years created a venue through which participants in a travel philosophy class can study and explore the life and the works of a philosopher or a school of philosophy in situ. While studying the works of philosophers, we often forget the context in and through which they were created. This context has to do with the places where they lived, the historical conditions of their times, and the people of these times, and I believe it is important to study them as much as it is to study their biographies from books. After consulting with several philosophy teachers who were all encouraging, I embarked on this project with a first Philomobile trip to the Nietzsche sites in May 2010 (more information about this trip is in the newsletter).

        Philomobile is a project designed for those who would like to explore and study philosophy in situ. We set two goals for such a philosophical endeavor: to recreate the conditions of the past on site within the context of our own times and to explore the other aspects of the epoch and the spirit of the times, in which philosophers lived. Some of these aspects are art, literature, architecture, science and religion.
      </p>
      <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
        Philomobile projects are designed both for those who are interested in the adventure of studying philosophy on the road. All Philomobile projects have a class component led by a professor and a sightseeing component led by a tour guide, both of which are integrated. For specific classes, please see our schedule.
